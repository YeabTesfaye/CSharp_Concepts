# Difference between IComparable and IComparer Interfaces

When it comes to sorting user-defined classes in C#, two key interfaces come into play: `IComparable` and `IComparer`. Understanding the difference between these interfaces is crucial for effective sorting operations.

## IComparable Interface

The `IComparable` interface provides a mechanism for defining a default way to compare instances of a class. It is typically implemented within the class itself, allowing instances of that class to be compared based on a predefined criterion. This interface is ideal when you have complete control over the implementation of the user-defined class.

### Key Points:
- Enables objects to be compared with one another.
- Defines a single method, `CompareTo`, which determines the natural ordering of objects.
- Suitable for classes where you have control over the implementation.

## IComparer Interface

The `IComparer` interface offers a solution for sorting classes when you don't have control over their implementation. This scenario arises when you need to sort instances of a class that you can't modify or access directly. `IComparer` allows you to define custom comparison logic externally, without modifying the original class.

### Key Points:
- Enables sorting on classes where you don't have control over the implementation.
- Defines a single method, `Compare`, which allows custom comparison logic between two objects.
- Useful for applying sorting on classes from external sources like DLLs, where you can't modify the implementation.

## Conclusion

In summary, while both `IComparable` and `IComparer` interfaces facilitate sorting operations in C#, they serve different purposes based on the level of control you have over the class implementation. `IComparable` is suitable for classes where you have complete control, while `IComparer` is ideal for sorting classes without modifying their implementation, such as when accessing classes from external sources like DLLs.
